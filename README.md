## 🌟 What is Myco?

**Myco** is a lightweight, expressive scripting language designed for simplicity, readability, and just a touch of magic. Inspired by every aspect of other languages I hate and my weird obsession with Fungi, Myco is built to be both intuitive and powerful for small scripts or full programs.

## 🍃 Features

- 🌙 **Clean, readable syntax**
- 🔮 **Dynamic typing** with `let`
- 🍂 **Functions, control flow, and loops**
- 🌲 **List and map support** *soon lol*
- 🧪 **Try-catch error handling**
- 🧙 **Mystical and themed syntax highlighting** with the Myco VS Code Extension

## 🔧 Example

```myco
let name = "Ivy";
func greet(person):
    print("Welcome to the woods,", person, "!");
end

greet(name);

for item in [1, 2, 3]:
    print("Found a mushroom with ID:", item);
end
