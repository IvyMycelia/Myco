   Expected output: `Myco v1.0.0`

2. **Run a simple test:**
   ```bash
   echo 'print("Hello, Myco!");' > hello.myco
   myco hello.myco
   ```
   Expected output: `Hello, Myco!`

3. **Run the full test suite:**
   ```bash
   myco pass.myco
   ```
   Expected output: `ALL TESTS PASSED!` (297/297 tests)

## IDE Integration

### Visual Studio Code

1. Install the Myco extension from the VS Code marketplace
2. Open any `.myco` file
3. Enjoy syntax highlighting, IntelliSense, and debugging support
